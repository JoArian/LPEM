    <h1>Task 5 - The URL</h1>
    
    <p>
      A <strong>URL</strong> (Unified Resource Locator) is the unique address of a file that can be accessed via the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as each building can be found by its address, consisting of street number, street number, street name, city, and postal code, any file can be found on the on the Internet can be traced by its URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      The address of a file is of course structured differently than a house address. In groups of 2, research the composition as well as the meaning of the parts of a of a URL and write your explanations in the solution for this task:
    </p>
      
      <code>htsta/chap02_hyperlinks/solutions/task5.html</code>
      
    <p>
      Use 
      <a href="files/urlparts.jpg">this image</a> 
      as a starting point. After the explanations, create 2 sample images of your own and add them to the document.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For URLs that reference local files, the directory path, starting with the drive letter on Windows, and the file name are required. Examples would be e.g. <code>C:\my_page\page.html</code> oder <code>Z:\page.html</code>. As protocol <code>file:///</code> is added before the drive letter.
