    <h1>Task 7 - Relative and absolute URLs/links</h1>
    
    <p>
      In the 
      <a href='task6.html'>previous task</a>
      we used different types of links. On the one hand we used relative links with which we linked our pages. Then, on the respective pages, we used absolute links to external websites.
    </p>
    
    <p>So let's go over both types again:</p>
    
    <h2>Absolute/Global URLs</h2>
    
    An absolute or global link denotes the absolute locality of a file. As already seen in 
    <a href='task5.html'>task 5</a>
    , the URL is composed of several parts.
    
    A global URL can always be inserted on any page and always points to the same destination.
    
    <h2>Relative URLs</h2>
    
    Relative URLs are a bit more complex. They refer to the location we are currently in. Here are a few examples:
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>./task7.html</strong> - A URL to another page in the same directory. (The ./ at the beginning is optional)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>../solutions/</strong> - The two dots (..) mean one level up in the directory structure, then into the directory loesungen. Since we have not specified a file, the search is for index.html.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    
    <p>
      Use 
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank">this</a>
      page to delve into the difference between <strong>absoluten</strong> and <strong>relative</strong> URLs.
		</p>
    <p>
      On the same page, under the item <cite>Now, You Try It</cite>, you can test your understanding of relative URLs. Do this until you have entered a correct relative path 3 times in a row.
