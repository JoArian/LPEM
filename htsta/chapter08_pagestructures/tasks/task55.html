          Think about which tags to use for the areas marked in red.

        <li>Paste the tags in the HTML.
          <strong>
            To keep the image clear, not all elements of the same type are always framed.
            Of course, you should still include the tags of all elements.

          It's not about recreating the style. So it is normal that your page will not look like in the picture.
