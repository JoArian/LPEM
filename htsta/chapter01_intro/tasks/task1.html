    <h1>Task 1 - Create basic framework</h1>

    <p>
      In this task we create the basis for our course.
      It is important that we keep a clean structure from the beginning.
      Thus, the content is easier to find for us, as well as for visitors and search engines.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a directory in your htsta directory for the first chapter.
        Naming convention: chapterXX_ABC .
        XX represents the chapter number and ABC the chapter name.
        Examples: chapter01_intro, chapter02_hyperlinks, ...
      </li>
      <li>
        You save the tasks for the respective chapters in the subfolder <em>tasks</em> of the respective chapter.
      </li>
      <li>
        You save the solutions to the tasks in the <em>solutions</em> of the respective chapter.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Note that all folder and file names contain only lowercase letters and no umlauts or special characters.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Folder structure</h2>

    <p>
      Create the folder structure for the first chapter as explained above.
      Copy this file into the subfolder <em>tasks</em>.
      The structure should be as follows:
    </p>

    <p><code>htsta/chapter01_intro/tasks/task1.html</code></p>
    <p>
      The slashes / separate the respective directories.
      This representation is also used in the navigation bar of the browser.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Create Homepage</h2>
    <p>
      Now create your first web page in the folder <em>chapter1_intro</em>.
    </p>
    <h3>Reference File</h3>
    <p>
      We first create a reference file with the basic HTML structure.
      This file will be the basis for all further web pages we create.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file should be saved as <em>template.html</em>.
    </p>

    (<code>chapter01_intro/template.html</code>)

    <p>
      To create HTML code we use a simple text editor such as Notepad++.
    </p>

    <h3>Homepage</h3>
    <p>
      With the help of our reference file we now create our first web page with content.

      The file is the start page and must therefore be called <em>index.html</em>.

      Use as title for your web page <em>HTSTA - Program static web pages</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Test and validation</h2>
    <p>
      Now use an internet browser to view the web page.
      Also make sure that your HTML code is correct and complies with the standard.
      You can check this with a validation tool, which is available both as plugins for browsers and <a href="https://validator.w3.org">online on the internet</a>.
