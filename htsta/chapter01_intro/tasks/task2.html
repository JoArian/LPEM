    <h1>Task 2 - Validation and Indentation</h1>
    <p>
      In this task we will go over the structure of the HTML code once again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Copy the files of this task back to the corresponding task folder:
    </p>

    <code>htsta/chapter01_intro/tasks/</code>

    <p>
      Also create a folder for the solutions in which you save the corrected files:
    </p>

    <code>htsta/chapter01_intro/solutions/</code>


    <h2>Basic structure</h2>

    <p>
      There are some errors in
      <a href='task2-e1.html'>this template file</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      First copy the file into the folder <em>solutions</em> and then correct the errors so that the validation is successful.
    </p>

    <h2>Indentation</h2>
    <p>
      First, take a look at the source code of
      <a href='task2-e2.html'>this page</a>.
	  As you note, the HTML code is not very readable.

      Edit the code according to the following rules:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Add a line break after each start tag and each end tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Split any line of text longer than half the screen with a line break.
      </li>
      <li>
        Indentate (&rarr; TAB) the entire content between all start and end tags.
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Troubleshooting/Validation</h2>
    <p>
      There are also some errors in the source code of the above
      <a href='task2-e2.html'>page</a>.
      Try to find them with the help of a validation tool and also correct them.
    </p>
