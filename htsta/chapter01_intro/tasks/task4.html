    <h1>Task 4 - Transfer to HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML offers a wealth of tags/elements to display the content according to its meaning.
      In Word, you can implement this using the various menu items.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the principle is the same in both cases.
      To illustrate this, in this task you will convert a Word document into an HTML file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Create the following file for this purpose:
    </p>

    <code>htsta/chapter1_intro/solutions/task4.html</code>

    <h2>Transfer to HTML</h2>
    <p>
      Convert the entire contents of this
      <a href='Transfer.docx'>Word document</a>
      into the HTML file <em>task4.html</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATTENTION: Special characters must be replaced with the appropriate special characters for HTML.
