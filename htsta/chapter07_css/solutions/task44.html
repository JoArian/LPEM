    <h2>Proverbs</h2>
    
    <h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
    
    <p>
      A <strong>proverb</strong> (from Latin: <em>proverbium</em>) is a simple and concrete saying, popularly known and
      repeated, that expresses a truth based on common sense or experience. They are often
      metaphorical. A proverb that describes a basic rule of conduct may also be known as a
      maxim. Proverbs fall into the category of formulaic language.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Proverbs are often borrowed from similar languages and cultures, and sometimes come
      down to the present through more than one language. Both the Bible (including, but not
      limited to the Book of Proverbs) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of Erasmus) have
      played a considerable role in distributing proverbs across Europe. Mieder has concluded
      that cultures that treat the Bible as their "major spiritual book contain between three
      hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible." However, almost every
      culture has examples of its own unique proverbs.
