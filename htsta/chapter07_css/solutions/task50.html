    <h2>Nr 1</h2>

      Can closures can save space in the closet. The secret lies in the two rings of the closures. Simply remove the cap from a Coke can, hang it around the hook of a coat hanger, and attach another coat hanger to the second free ring. This allows you to hang significantly more clothes in the closet.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Nr 2</h2>
    <p>
      Where many cables are stored, a cable tangle quickly develops. A box lined with empty toilet paper rolls prevents this. The cardboard rolls are placed vertically next to each other in the box so that cables rolled up in them can be stored separately.
    </p>   
    
    
    <h2>Nr 3</h2>

      If you notice in the mirror that your dress shirt still has a wrinkled collar, you don't have to take it off and dig out the iron. In a hurry, a straightening iron will help: Simply clamp the wrinkled collar in between and smooth it out in front of the mirror.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Nr 4</h2>
    <p>
      Foldback clamps are not only suitable for a photo stand, they also create order in the cable clutter on your own desk. To do this, attach the paper clips to the edge of the desk, for example, and pull the plugs of frequently used cables, such as the smartphone charging cable, through the handles of the foldback clips.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 5</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of placing T-shirts on top of each other in the closet drawer, stack them upright next to each other. This way, each T-shirt can be identified in the drawer right away without always lifting each T-shirt individually and messing up the pile of clothes.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 6</h2>
    <p>
      Before reheating, noodles, rice dishes and the like should be arranged in a circle on the plate with a hole in the center. Then they heat up much more in the microwave.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 7</h2>
    <p>
      Better than holding a nail by hand while hammering is to hold it in place with a clothespin. Your fingers will thank you for it.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 8</h2>
    <p>
      To prevent glasses from fogging up, rub a trace of petroleum jelly on the lenses and rub until the petroleum jelly is spread wafer-thin without affecting the transparency.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 9</h2>
    <p>
      Prevent rugs from slipping on smooth floors by placing double-sided tape under the edges. Double-sided tape also prevents loose rugs from 'wandering' on carpeted floors.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 10</h2>
    <p>
      Cloudburst? Soaked shoes will dry out quickly and stay in shape if you stuff them with crumpled newspaper. The paper very quickly removes the moisture from the leather.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 11</h2>
    <p>
      If doors creak, they should not be oiled. Instead, rub the joints with a little petroleum jelly. It does not dry out as quickly as oil. By the way, entrance doors fall into place much more easily if you vigorously scribble over the slanted surface of the latch with a pencil.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 12</h2>
    <p>
      In order to catch flies more easily, one must proceed against the light so as not to cast a shadow on the fly prematurely. The fly recognizes the shadow first and flies away.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 13</h2>
    <p>
      If you accidentally spill water on a book, you can place it briefly in the freezer. This removes the moisture and the pages do not stick together.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Nr 14</h2>
    <p>
      You want to open a previously shaken champagne or sparkling wine bottle without the contents splashing out at you. Simply turn the bottle upside down for 30 seconds, after which you can open the bottle without any problems.
