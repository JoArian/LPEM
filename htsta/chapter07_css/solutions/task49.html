      We look at the different size units by changing the font sizes (<code>font-size</code>).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Absolute units</h3>
    
    <p>
      First change the font size of the <code>body</code> elements.
      Specify some values <code>pt</code> and <code>px</code>. 
      Does it make sense to use these units?
    </p>
    
    <p>
     Depends on what you need them for but I think px makes sense
    </p>
    
    <h3>Relative Units</h3>
    
    <p>
      a. Now enter a percentage value for the font size. What do the percentages refer to?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It refers to how big it is compared to its parent element
    </p>
    
    <p>
      b. Now specify a value in <code>em</code>. 
      How is the font size calculated from the <code>em</code> value?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If the font size is 2px originally with 2em it would become 4px (doubling it) so em just multiplies
    </p>
    
    <p>
      c. Now double the font size of the elements of the class <code>resized</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      d. In the second paragraph there is a nested <code>strong</code> element. 
      Halve the font size of this element by adding unit
      <code>em</code> and <code>%</code> once. What do the two units refer to?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your answer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      e. What happens if you use the unit <code>rem</code> instead of <code>em</code>. 
      Now what does the specified unit refer to?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your answer.
