    <h1>Task 33 - Text and meaning</h1>
    
    <h2>Phrase elements</h2>
    <p>
      Text is not necessarily just text. Text parts with special meaning (e.g. "important text" or "deleted text") can be defined in HTML5 by <strong>Phrase elements</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The content of phrase elements may only consist of plain text and/or additional phrase elements.
    </p>

      The page <a href="../solutions/task33.html"><code>../solutions/task33.html</code></a>
